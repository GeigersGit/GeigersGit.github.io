                        <p>
                            One thing that's always facinated me is music visualization.<br /><br />
                            Being able to experience music with more than just our sense of sound and touch is crazy and mesmerizing to me.
                            Dispite my fascination, I always found myself disappointed by the ones that were available, as
                            visualizers that rendered in real time weren't especially appealing to look at,
                            and the ones that were visually stunning were usually After Effects animations that took hours to render for a single song.
                            The Unity game engine provided the perfect environment for rendering something like that in real time.
                        </p>

                                    Version one of the visualizer, which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82Q6DRqf9H4" style="color:pink;">here</a>,
                                    was published on YouTube in March of 2014 and currently has about three quarters of a million views.
                                    After a bunch of tinkering and user feedback, version two (seen here) was uploaded a few months later in August.
                                    Since then, many other features have been included and a handful of custom versions have been contracted for small-scale streamers and
                                    artists.

                                    An array of frequencies is brought in each frame using a fourier transform library,
                                    assigned to one of 64 bar groups, averaged with the rest of the frequencies in the group, and assigned as a
                                    height value to one of the bars of the visualizer. A layer of water is placed to hide the bottom half of the
                                    bars and let the light emitted by the bars reflect into the camera.
