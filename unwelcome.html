                        <h2>About The Project</h2>
                        <p>
                            The first side project I undertook after graduating college, Unwelcome is an unfinished mobile game concept that takes place
                            in a classic medieval RPG setting populated by small immersion-breaking robots. The story is: you're a lowly resident of a small town
                            that 'hero' adventurers often travel through, and you've had enough of them barging into your home - breaking pots - taking food and money - all
                            in the name of "saving the world". You finally snap and break a pot over one of their heads - causing you to become wanted and the
                            target of all other heroes in the area. You must then defend your home from parties of heroes by using their powers against them and
                            gather their dropped supplies to buy traps and guards to help defend against larger groups of heroes.
                            <br /> Eventually, you find yourself the main boss of a sizable dungeon.

                                I was hired full time before I had the chance to finish it, but I managed to get some basic gameplay elements down - the heroes
                                will path toward your movable treasure chest by default and steal money out of it, but will turn and attack you if they see you. 
                                All of their attacks are deadly - but not just to you. By rolling around and leading them into each other,
                                you can take them out. The heroes come as a continuous wave at the moment and drop money when defeated. The money can be used to expand
                                your house by tapping on an adjacent building square or to buy magic mirrors that reflect wizard fireballs. You lose if you run out of
                                money or are killed.

                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
                                <p>
                                    The adjacent room squares, inside walls, and floor are covered in touch-sensitive panels that will automatically purchase a new
                                    house extension or trap when tapped. The adjacent squares will obviously add space to your house to move around in, and the wall
                                    panels will purchase magic mirrors. I haven't decided what to do with the floor squares yet or how to implement the purchasing of
                                    guards. I really hope to pick this project back up at some point.
