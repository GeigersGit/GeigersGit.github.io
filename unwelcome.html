                                    The first side project I undertook after graduating college, Unwelcome is an unfinished mobile game concept that takes place
                                    in a classic medieval RPG setting populated by small robots. The objective is to protect your life savings from "heroes" that would take it in the name of the greater good.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            The story is: you're a lowly resident of a small town
                            that 'hero' adventurers often travel through, and you've had enough of them barging into your home - breaking pots - taking food and money - all
                            in the name of "saving the world". You finally snap and break a pot over one of their heads - causing you to become wanted and the
                            target of all other heroes in the area. You must then defend your home from parties of heroes by using their powers against them and
                            gather their dropped supplies to buy traps and guards to help defend against larger groups of heroes.
                            <br /> Eventually, you find your house has become a sizable dungeon, and you've become the big boss heroes have to steal supplies for.

                                    I was hired full time before I had the chance to finish it, but I managed to get some basic gameplay elements down - the heroes
                                    will path toward your movable treasure chest by default and steal money out of it, but will turn and attack you if they see you.
                                    All of their attacks are deadly - but not only to you. The heroes drop money when defeated, which can be used to expand
                                    your house by tapping on an adjacent building square or to buy magic mirrors that reflect wizard fireballs.

                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-8 col-12-medium">

                                    The adjacent room squares, inside walls, and floor are covered in touch-sensitive panels that will automatically purchase a new
                                    house extension or trap when tapped. The adjacent squares will obviously add space to your house to move around in, and the wall
                                    panels will purchase magic mirrors. I haven't decided what to do with the floor squares yet or how to implement the purchasing of
                                    guards. I really hope to pick this project back up at some point.
